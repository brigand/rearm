# Intent

The Ctx module provides a stable and declarative interface to the concept of "context" in React. It's represented as a single object with
a `Provider` and a `use` hook as the two sides.

Unlike a typical React context, a component may subscribe to specific parts of the context,
or computations based on the context. This has been a very important aspect of react-redux for many years, and can
now be leveraged with custom contexts.

## Usage

First create your context instance. You may create as many as you like, and there is no interaction
between separate contexts, so it's suitable for applications and libraries.

```javascript
import { makeCtx } from 'rearm/lib/Ctx';
const MyCtx = makeCtx();
```

If you're using typescript, you may wish to explicitly define a type for the context. As you would expect,
both `Provider` and `use` will incorporate the generic in their types.

```typescript
import { makeCtx, Ctx } from 'rearm/lib/Ctx';
const MyCtx: Ctx<{ color: string}> = makeCtx();
```

Anywhere in the tree you can define the context by rendering a `Provider` with the `value`
you would like to pass through context. You may have multiple instances of the `Provider` rendered
in different parts of the page, or "shadow" a parent provider if they're nested. A `MyCtx.Provider`
must exist as an (indirect) parent of any component attempting to call `MyCtx.use`.

```javascript
render() {
  return (
    <MyCtx.Provider value={{ color: 'hotpink' }}>
      <B />
    </MyCtx.Provider>
  );
}
```

You may then access the context by calling `Ctx.use` with an optional selector function. If not provided,
then the entire context value will be returned.

```javascript
function B() {
  const color = Ctx.use(state => state.color);
  return <p style={{ color }}>Hello, World!</p>;
}
```

If you use typescript, then the value of `color` should be inferred to be `string`, as we defined
the context to be `Ctx<{ color: string }>.

## Example

Here we have a few components that share a context with a foreground color, background color,
and a callback which can update either.

```typescript
type Theme = {
  fg: string;
  bg: string;
  update: (key: 'fg' | 'bg', value: string) => void;
};
const ThemeCtx: Ctx<Theme> = makeCtx();
```

Try pressing the buttons and notice the update counters, which are incremented on
each render of the respective components.

<CtxExample />

The first section, it accesses the entire context with `const theme = ThemeCtx.use()`, and as
such the containing component will render in reaction to any context update.

The other two components either access the foreground or background color individually.

```typescript
const fg = ThemeCtx.use((theme) => theme.fg);
```

The result of evaluating that function doesn't change if only `theme.bg` is updated, so this
component isn't forced to update itself for changes it's unaffected by.

Note that by default, any update in React will cause the entire sub tree to update, so using
an update blocking technique like `React.memo` or `React.useMemo` is required to limit the
natural rendering caused by any state change.

The example uses such a technique in the root component. You normally don't need to worry about this,
but if you are having performance issues due to context updates, it's a good thing to try.

```typescript
function CtxExample(props: {}) {
  const [fg, setFg] = React.useState(FG_COLORS[0]);
  const [bg, setBg] = React.useState(BG_COLORS[0]);
  const theme: Theme = {
    fg,
    bg,
    update(key, value) {
      key === 'fg' ? setFg(value) : setBg(value);
    },
  };

  const children = useMemo(
    () => (
      <div className="rearm-ctx-example">
        <Selector />
        <Page />
      </div>
    ),
    [],
  );

  return <ThemeCtx.Provider value={theme}>{children}</ThemeCtx.Provider>;
}
```
