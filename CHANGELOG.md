## 0.12.0

major Ctx changes, reducing API

- the `map` prop was removed.
- `subscribe` was renamed to `select`
- `inject` replaced with `set`, which doesn't merge
- support primitives for state
- consider non-plain objects as always non-equal

## pre 0.12.0

Changelog didn't exist, but all APIs were
very unstable.
