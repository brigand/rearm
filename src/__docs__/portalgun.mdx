# @rearm/use-portal-gun

## Intent

The PortalGun module allows defining UI in one place in the tree, and shooting it to a near-by location elsewhere in the tree.


## Usage

```javascript
import usePortalGun from 'rearm/lib/PortalGunHooks';
```

First you'll need a hook `usePortalGun`. Each hook gets its own Source and Dest component. You may use Dest multiple times, but with multiple Source elements the order of results is undefined.


```javascript
function TestUi() {
  const [Source, Dest] = usePortalGun();

  return (
    <>
      <TestSource Source={Source} />
      <div data-testid="dest">
        <Dest />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

Then you'll need a component to provide the value for `Source`. In this example, that'll be done inside `TestSource`.

```javascript
function TestSource({ Source }) {
  const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(1);

  return (
    <>
      <button data-testid="incr" onClick={() => setCounter(c => c + 1)}>Incr</button>
      <Source>
        <span data-testid="source">{`Count: ${counter}`}</span>
      </Source>
    </>
  );
}
```

Note that in this case, `TestSource` holds the full state and defines the UI for representing that state, but `TestUi` decides where to put the rendered output.

If there isn't currently a Source element, then Dest will render nothing.
